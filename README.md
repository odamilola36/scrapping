# scrapping

I used python to scrap data from one of my favorite JavaScript website 

I did this using selenium and beautiful soup, both are python libraries

#selenium
Selenium was used for automation, to fill forms, click on different elements on a page

#beautiful soup 
with beautiful soup I scrapped data off the pages selenium took me to.

in all, it was a beautilful experience.
